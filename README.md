# **Machine Learning Software (Text Classifier) That Predicts Whether Universities Are Learning Based Or Not!**
I developed machine learning software based on text classification system that predicts whether universities are based on learning or not. I guessed whether universities were important for education based on comments made by people according to the text classification system. The words of Elon Musk, the greatest scientist in the field of artificial intelligence in the world, were also processed. Then the prediction was made with the text that I created myself. Classification graph is produced with Extra Tree. The accuracy rate is around 100%. The parameters have been carefully prepared.
Note: The software and data are completely original.

_Example:_ 

`change_detection_feature = CountVectorizer()

change_tfid = TfidfTransformer()

y_change_function = CountVectorizer()`

_Outpot :_ `Yes! Don't need to Univeristy for learning,  TRUE
'not for learning' =>  "to learn; we must develop ourselves individually. we don't need universities."
Accuracy Score:  100.0 x:  1 `
